# Exotic Ammo mod for 7 Day to Die
## Description
The Exotic Ammo mod enhances your 7 Days to Die gameplay experience by introducing a variety of exotic ammunition types.

This mod includes instructions on crafting glass, fire, high density, shock, and concussion ammo, applicable to all calibers including robotic turrets, grenades, and rockets.

## Features

- **Bulk Crafting & Holy Hand Grenade**: Upon reading all chapters, unlock bulk crafting and the knowledge to craft the formidable Holy Hand Grenade.
- **Loot System**: Find Exotic Ammo and books in loot, loot crates, book bundles, military POI’s, or as quest rewards. Many traders will also have these items for sale.
